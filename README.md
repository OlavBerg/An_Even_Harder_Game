# An_Even_Harder_Game
I made this game during a course at Link√∂ping University in 2017. It is based on the browser game "World's Hardest Game" (https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game).

The game consists of 10 levels. The goal of each level is to move from the start area, colored green, to the finish area, colored pink. Each level contains enemies (red squares).
If you touch an enemy, you get sent back to the start of the level. Some levels contain coins (yellow circles). On those levels, you have to collect all of them in order to finish
the level.
